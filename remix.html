			<h1>REMIX PROJECT ASSESSMENT MEMO</h1>
			<p><h3>When I saw the requirement for this assignment, I started to think about which theme of topic will be the easiest one not only for our group but also for the audience to review and understand our assignment. During the process of composing my group. I received the views from each group member which let me to think about how my project can be revised in a higher level. Since we had four people in our group and each one had different opinion and cited different part of my assignment, I had to decide the order of their citations in my assignment since it would affect how the audience reviewed our project. The audience should play a role like a student since our purpose of the project is to encourage people to take risk in their life. </h3>
			<h3>The first time when I played the Grand Theft Auto, a game which contains a large number of satire American cultures and the content of the social phenomenon, while, the game pornographic violence caused controversy, some players let off their steams of the society by this game. They used to endure the injustice instead of encourage themselves to change the bad situation. The challenging part of this project was arrange the tasks for our group member since each person had different opinion of my essay, I should give them the part which they were interested in, then it would be easier for them to write and for me to compose. I took a systematic approach in this project.  The example of Martin Luther King was the most beneficial for you since it let me know that no equality can be achieved without taking risks. One may encounter a great deal of challenge during his or her pursuit of justice. Throughout this process, a person has to face all challenge by taking risks or otherwise he will eventually fail. While, example of Thomas Alva Edison had least beneficial since it had been written a lot of times so that people felt boring about that. </h3>
			<h3>Each of our group member was awesome, they finished their job well and helped others a lot. Thanks to the cooperation of our group member, we competed our project perfectly and the project was fruitful.</h3>
			<h3>I thought I planned this work very well, from the basic to complex and keep a question that people can think about during the video. If I had more time, I would add some senses from the reality that audience can understand our purpose better. </h3>
			<h3>I thought the effective aspect of my documentary was to use picture to instead of words. Since when one saw words, especially people from different countries that native language was not English, they have to transform into their brain and gain the point, while when one saw picture, he or she can understand it at once. Since I am an international student at MSU so that I had experience of that feeling, I decided to use picture instead of words. </h3></p>
