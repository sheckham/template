			<h1>How Advertisements Affect Social Society</h1>
			<p>The issue of how advertisements affect social society which related to field of economic that was my major in MSU may arouse much controversy among people of diverse backgrounds. As known to all, the advertisements are seen everywhere in our daily life. In the other word, the advertisements are inseparable to our life. However, it bring not only the advantages such as letting people know the newest products and preferential information about the stuffs people want, but also the disadvantages to our life such as it annoyed people’s life in somehow since not everybody is willing to receive the advertisements. 
As I did an interview to one of my friends who named Shiwei Yin, a graduate student at Michigan State University at the Apartment of Business, told me some basic knowledge about advertisements. Advertising helps the suppliers to promote the sales of their products and services, helps the consumers to get the necessary information about the products and services they want, and promote consumption of products and service. There are many media for advertising. The most basic medium is the newspaper, the advertisement of which are classified clearly and in detail, easy for reader to look for the information they need according to the classification. The newspaper advertising cause very little upset for the readers who do not want to read advertisement. Advertisement in newspaper are practical and civilized. Advertisement in magazines are most specifically aimed. For instance, advertisements in fashion magazines are for fashionable women consumers, the targets of the advertisements in sports magazines are athletes and sports activists. Advertisement on radio and TV are more vivid and impressive, but not as specific and easy to find as those on newspaper and magazines. Nowadays, the advertisements on radio and TV last too long and affect the normal listening and watching of the audience. That’s a disrespect of the audiences and caused widespread antipathy. In some countries, TV and Radio station are state-run and do not allowed adverting. However, some businessmen dial others’ private phones at random to promote products or service, affect others’ private life. Such businessmen do not respect others and damage their own image which will produce the opposite results. 
What’s more, I product an interview to one of my classmates who named Qiuyue Deng, a sophomore at University of California, Los Angeles. He was study at advertisement at UCLA, and told me something about the modern advertising's impact on society that the modern advertising influence on society can be separated as five part. First of all, modern advertising promoted and accelerated the development of the society; secondly, advertising and new technology development mutually reinforcing; thirdly, modern advertisement made influence on social culture that guided the audience with both a correct concept of culture and way of life concept and behavior; fourth, the influence of modern advertising to the public behavior that advertising in guiding the public behavior, playing an important role in creating or fading society popular; finally, provided entertainment topic which rich amateur life. In addition to that, public service advertising became more and more popular at present. Government pay for the advertisement and call up people to do the right things. He also mentioned how he thought about how advertisements worked in our life. The most basic function of advertising is the cognitive function. Through advertising, which can help consumers know and understand all kinds of commodities trademarks, performance, application, use and maintenance method, buy site and buy method, price and so on, to convey information, communication, production and marketing. As the saying goes, good products should with good publicity. But in real life, there are some enterprises confused to the role of advertising, think advertising spend too much, do more harm than good. As a result, they would rather far apart, trains, ships, worked so hard to sell everywhere, rather than advertising. Practice has proved, advertising in terms of economic message, is the most quickly, save, and one of the most effective means. Good products by means of the modern science of advertising, the result is many times higher than human do. A good advertisement can induce consumers’ interests and feelings since consumers always buy the goods by their desires. For instance, a tobacco company sent a salesman to bay tourist area to promote the company's "crown" brand cigarettes, however, the cigarette market has been taken over by other company's brand in this region, the salesman puzzling over no meter. In accidentally, he was inspired by the "no smoking" sign, he made a lot of large billboards, writed "no smoking" characters at billboards and add a line at the end: "crown" brand "is no exception. Results greatly aroused the interest of tourists, rushed to buy "crown" brand cigarettes, open the market for the company. 
Mass advertising is an important competition strategy of the enterprise. When a new commodity listed, if consumers do not know its name, purpose, location, purchase method, it is hard to open up an outlet, especially in the market competition is intense, product upgrading greatly speed up the situation, enterprises through large-scale advertising, can make consumers to the product of the appeal, expand the market is very beneficial for the enterprise. Raise public awareness of goods is one of the important contents of enterprise competition, and advertising is indispensable weapon publicize merchandise. Savvy entrepreneurs always good at using advertising, improve the "reputation" of enterprises and products, so as to raise the "worth", promoted competition, expanded the market. Modern production category is numerous, the new product emerge in endlessly, and monthly sales, it is hard to buy what they need in time, while advertising through product knowledge, can play the role of guiding consumption. After some consumers purchased products, because of product performance and the structure is not very understanding. Therefore, in the use and maintenance problems tended to occur. Through advertising introduction to commodity knowledge also can better guide consumers to do a good job of repair and maintenance products so as to prolong the life time of the product. Good advertising, in fact, is a fine piece of art, not only real, specifically introduced the goods to the people, and let people through the image of view, appreciation, riches life, sets up the new consumption concept, increases enjoyment of spiritual beauty, and in the art of osmosis, generation buyers’ desire. What’s more, good advertising can also help consumers set up the correct moral values, the outlook on life, cultivate people's spiritual civilization, and to the consumer to science and technology knowledge, cultivate people's sentiments.
While, different type of advertisement would have different effect. For instance, last year, the election of president took place in the United State, vagueness and logical fallacies beneath the clarity and credibility of campaign advertisements.  
  	According to George Orwell, modern political phrases are featured with ambiguity and total inability (692).  Despite the fact that at first glance, both advertisements “No, I can’t” (Romney) and “Women’s voices” (Obama) seem to manage to convince voters with reasonable logic, after careful analysis of two political campaign advertisements “No, I can’t” (Romney) and “Women’s Voices” (Obama), I find that the language in both advertisements strikingly resonate with Orwell’s argument. Obama and Romney either use hazy words to exemplify their statements or make a deliberate misinterpretation out of context to refute the other. As a result, reality is twisted by the “staleness of imagery” and “lack of precision” (Orwell 691).
  Both candidates fail to articulate their aims when they try to build positive images upon voters. Vagueness in words of both advertisements can disguise the reality. In “No, I can’t (Romney), words like “what we need is someone who can point forward” are meant to convey that Mitt Romney can lead citizens to a bright and promising future. However, words like these fail to point to any specific object. What does “forward” actually symbolize? Words like “point forward” are merely used by Romney to save himself from the trouble of inventing new explicit phrases.  Additionally, “put forward” can may deceive some voters since Romney has his own interpretation of the word “forward”; however, at the same time the vagueness of “forward” allows voters to think Romney might indicate something different. The phrases “What we need is job plan” and “leadership instead of more excuses” (No, I can’t) also lack details. What is the “job plan” about and is the plan valid or not? What’s the actual content beneath the “leadership”? Romney does not answer each either of the questions. Instead he allows his hearers to form up the concept of “job plan” and “leadership” respectively. It can be seen that these words are used in a dishonest way. Words like “a president who represents my values and my rights”, “The President is the only choice to help us forward” and “ I am standing up for the future of my daughter, the future I want her to see” in “Women’s voices” (Obama) are also more or less used in the same way. Different people could have different comprehension of “values”, “rights”, “forward” and “the future”. Spokeswomen The spokeswomen in the ad simply have a general meaning that we should vote for Obama; however, all of them just express their support for Obama without any detail of what they are saying. Voters will be misguided if they are just being told what’s right without being told why that’s right. Thus, “staleness of imagery” (Orwell 691) can make voters form wrong ideas of the reality. 
Not only can the “staleness of imagery” (Orwell 691) can twist the reality, but also “lack of precision” can disguise the reality. It is especially true in “No, I can’t” (Romney). To arouse voters’ negative feeling upon Obama more reasonable, Romney intentionally makes Obama’s own words like “things would get better”, “Yes, we can” and “change we can believe in” beat against “you can’t change the Washington from inside”. Such striking contrast indicates that Obama is the person who goes back on his words, reinforcing the bad figure of Obama. However, Romney makes a deliberate misinterpretation of context. The complete statement of Obama is “The most important lesson I have learned is that you can’t change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside. That’s how I got elected and that’s how the big accomplishments like healthcare got done, was because we mobilized the American people to speak out” (Foxnews.com). Obama tries to involve more ordinary Americans in election by saying so. Instead of going back on his word, Obama intends to demonstrate the power of citizens. The way Romney defames Obama, according to Magill, can be defined as “the straw man argument” (open.salon.com). It is much easier to debate, since Romney only has to protest against the striking argument he has made for Obama out of inaccuracy. If voters fail to find the whole words of Obama, they are very likely to be deceived by Romney’s misrepresentation and regard Obama as a great promiser. It can be seen that “lack of precision” (Orwell 691) can prevent voters from getting to the depth of the reality. 
In addition to “the straw man argument” (Magill open.salon.com), there are other logical fallacies in both advertisements that lead voters to forming wrong ideas of the reality. In “Women’s voices” (Obama), there are a lot many prominent women celebrities, such as Beyoncé Knowles, Eva Longoria, Gloria Steinem, Jennifer Lopez, and Ashley Judd and so on. All of them deliver their support for Obama through sharing “how President Obama has fought for women's rights; how he'll continue to move this country forward; and how women will help decide this election”  (Women’s voices). However, some of words of these well-known spokeswomen are found to be illogical. For example, “I find such a champion in President Obama and which I why I passionately support him specifically because I am a woman” was said by Eva Longoria in “Women’s voices”. It is inconsistent with reality that Eva attributes her support for Obama to her sex rather than his character or policy. Her lack in further evidence to consolidate her argument might mislead voters.  What’s more, the “Women’s voices” has the logical fallacy known as “Argumentum Ad Populum”, which presumes that a belief should be is authentic if that belief is held by most people (Magill open.salon.com). Obama invites those famous spokeswomen to affect the choice of voters since according to Magill’s theory, voters who tend to follow the majority are very likely to be persuaded by these women celebrities even some arguments of the celebrities lack evidence. If voters just follow the trend without actual thoughts, the election result does not reflect the reality, but only reflects which candidate is more popular.
  According to Frank Luntz, the most powerful force known to mankind is words and emotion (710). Thus, the reality can be twisted to a greater extent by “staleness of imagery” and “lack of precision” (Orwell 691) accompanied by emotion. In “No, we can’t”, the facial expression of people from different backgrounds are similarly full of doubts, disappointment and anger when they list Obama’s failure in keeping his words. Contrarily, when they make an appeal for Mitt Romney, determination and hope can be seen from their facial expression. Such a contrast consolidates words that disguise the reality, and causes audience to form the same negative emotions upon Obama and positive ones upon Romney. Similarly, in “Women’s voices” (Obama), every single female celebrity shows their admiration and support for Obama by their words such as “I find such a champion in President Obama and which is why I passionately support” and “We have got to get out there; we have to make sure this man stays in office” mixed with positive facial expressions and gestures, such as smiles and waving their hands out of excitement. The positive signal from words accompanied with emotions makes the logical fallacies negligible. These results suggest that appeal to emotions can help campaigns fulfill their aims and democratically desirable behavior can be aroused.  Thus, words accompanied with emotion can disguise the reality to a greater extent.
  	Using images and music is also a persuasive technique to arouse emotion in making campaign advertisements. As Brader’s study demonstrates, “political advertisements can change the way citizens get involved and make choices simply by using images and music to evoke emotions” (onlinelibrary.wiley.com). The music in “No, we can’t” is heavy, leading people to the fear of being forced to move back in with parents. As a consequence of that fear aroused by music, people tend to resonate with the negative figure of Obama who breaks his promise. Thus fear can provoke withdrawal. Unlike “No, I can’t”, the music in “Women’s voices” fills people with enthusiasm. In “The Enthusiasm Experiment”, Brader states that impact of campaign advertisements on voters can be strikingly changed by containing positive messages in enthusiasm-eliciting music. After being persuaded by words of female celebrities, voters have been very likely to vote for Obama. Uplifting music, as a catalyst, encourages voters greatly to make that decision. Voters will be more willing to vote after exposure to the emotional appeal. Furthermore, they tend to vote for the candidate according to preexisting preference. It can be seen that emotions can be elicited by the manipulated music, compelling people to make predictable choices.  Thus, music can work as catalyst to help language disguise the reality.
  With all the analysis above, it can be safely concluded that both “staleness of imagery” and “lack of precision” (Orwell 691) will twist the reality. Furthermore, emotion, especially aroused by music can also work as a catalyst to expand the extent of twist, and make logical fallacies negligible. To be an objective voter, we should get be aware of this feature of political campaign advertisements.
