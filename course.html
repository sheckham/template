			<h1>Final Progress Report</h1>
			<p>Hi, dear incoming student of class WRA110. As an international student, the first year of writing class is a little bit difficult for me to go through whole the project. The format of project is totally different from what I had learned from my country. Sometimes, I failed to understand the requirement well. What’s more, the grammar problem always was a big issue for us. However, the hardworking is the key to success, by persistence and hardworking, I finished all my project and get a good score for it. In one word, try to do every project and try your best to do the project well is the key to get high score in this class. Group work also play an important role in this class, in the lasted two assignment, we were required to be enrolled in group and work the project together. 
	The Lived Experiences Project is the first and the easiest project I did in this class.  This project required us to create a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology has impacted your choice of a major or career at the present time. The first time when I saw this requirement, I was confused about how to write this project. Like tell somebody a story? I thought it should not be a writing project in university level. I thought about it myself for a long time and then asked the teacher. The result shocked me, she said this assignment was like telling others a story about your decision to select this field as your major which I though should not be as a university writing course level. However, the propose of this assignment was to introduce how we choose the current major and let us to get similar with this course, the further assignment would be much harder than this one.  The process of this assignment was easy for me since the only thing I have to do was to remember why and how I choose to study on this major. In addition to the writing project, we were also to be asked to establish a personal website which would contain whole the project and the blog we did in this semester. This assignment almost made me crazy since it was too complex to understand how to do that. I tried is lots of times, however, it still did not work since I missed the step that called sync. With the help of teacher, I success to create it. However, there still a lot of problem such as how to upload our project and how to create a related page that would be used for the further assignment. I did not figure out this requirement clearly until the October, a month after the assignment be arranged. 
	The Cultural Analysis Proposal is the second project I did in this class. This assignment ask me through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to investigate a specific social issue and its import on society. This assignment challenged me a lot, specially it required 1,800 - 2,100 words in length. I never wrote an essay in this length. I started to think about the structure of this assignment again and again. How I can do to make this essay had a at least 1800 words in length become the main question I thought at the beginning. With the process of writing this assignment, I gradually understand that we do not have to worry about how many words it asked from the requirement. Once we clearly know how you plan to write and go on write what you thought, the word length will be enough when you wrote down everything you wanted to state. The second problem I met in this assignment was to find out the an artifact of popular culture (a video game, a music video, a movie, a TV show, etc.) and explain how that artifact illustrates or depicts either a group of people or your social issue. I tried to search for a lot of resource and seek for which one was the best for me to explain my purpose of my essay. In this step, we should choose the one which would fit our theme best instead of which we were interested in.  During the process of writing this assignment, I searched a lot of examples which can be cited in my project and to demonstrate my view. Each resource I used cost me lots of time. First of all, I found out what resource I needed, second, I tried to summary the resources in my own words, finally, made the resources connected to the project and made it easy for not only myself, but also the reader who reading my project easy to catch my main purpose of this part. In the second project, we have to hand in our draft to the Eli Review, we were asked to do peer review at this website and write our revision plan and shared with our instructor. This part let me lose a lot of score since I misunderstand our instructor’s instruct and forgot to share my revision plan I made. We should understand every requirements it arranged clearly in this class. 
	The Formal Research Report is the third project I did in this class. This assignment did really shocked me when I saw that at least be 2,700-3,000 words in length. I even can not believe my eye when I saw the requirement. This assignment also asked us to do a Library Activity which we should go to the library and decided which topic we would go on to work. It was a big problem for me since I never went to the library before and did not know how to search for the article I needed through the library system. With the help of the instructor at library, I figured out how to use it. The requirement also asked us to analysis two articles from different genre. This was a challenge for me as well because I should consider both whether I can analysis it well and whether it fit my research paper. The most difficult part of this assignment was to conduct two interview with a person who teaches major courses or does research in that discipline and with a person who practices in a field related to that discipline. I tried to find out the teacher who was teaching on this field and make an appointment to conduct an interview to him. The conversation between us were little bit strange since I used to forget or do not know the words I wanted to use which make the teacher confusing. An interview with student was much easier since I had a lot of friends that study at this field. In order to make my assignment well, I saw a lot of videos thay related to my theme and used some of them to my essay. Use the things happened in our daily life to make my research paper more convinced. This assignment also taught the right way to cited other’s project like articles, books, words, etc. 
	The Multimedia Remix Project is the fourth project I did in this class. This project gives us the opportunity to revise and transmediate one of our earlier projects, strengthening the original purpose of the piece while transforming it into an alternative form of a short documentary. We can work in groups on the documentary and our work must be based on either the Lived Experiences Report, Cultural Analysis Proposal, or Formal Research Report by someone in the group.  This work was the most interesting one though it cost me three weekends. Our group decided to meet on each Sunday afternoon to plan our documentary. We also keep contact on our phone to exchange the idea we had. As the leader of the group, I divided our project in four part, each person had their own work to deal with. When we finished our own job, we upload to Dropbox for the other group member to see how we plan to do in our own part. While, if somebody had any better ideas or found some problems on the personal project, we would go on to check it out and make it perfect. This assignment also enhanced our relationship between classmates, gave us an opportunity to make friend with others. Although it cost most time of the four assignments we did, we did really enjoy it. 
	Overall, this is a class that developing skills, knowledge, and attitudes that improve the quality of life for self and others through scholarly, social, and professional activities. When the instructor asked us to do a personal website for this class, I complained why the writing class required to do things like computer class. However, it benefited me a lot since by doing the website let me able to review all my assignment I did in this course, also the blog I wrote on the website can help me to recall what happened through the whole semester.
