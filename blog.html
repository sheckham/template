			<h3>In today’s class, we are required to go on with the Lived Experience Project. In my opinion, it is really an easy job for us since I do not have to collect any information or do survey to finish this job, what I have to do was try my best to recall my memory that why and how I choose my current major. Through the process of recalling the memory, I remembered the happy things happened before, how I went through the difficult step by step. I firmly believed that this is the world one was shaped by the decision he or she made. One may encounter a great deal of challenge during his or her pursuit of justice. Throughout this process, a person has to face all challenge by courage or otherwise he will eventually fail. The experience of the people in the past always inspire me to be better. </h3>
			<h3>A good news from today is I make friend with two people in this class during this class. We are all come from China. Both of them are the freshman. They asked me a lot of question about study at MSU and I shared my experience and some key to get a good GPA in courses.

This assignment almost make me crazy since it was too complex to understand how to do that. I tried is lots of times, however, it still did not work since I missed the step that called sync. With the help of teacher, I success to create it. However, there still a lot of problem such as how to upload our project and how to create a related page that would be used for the further assignment. I did not figure out this requirement clearly and I feel boring and complain that why we should create a website as we are in the writing course? We ought to write essay instead of making the website right? It do really confused me a lot. However, it is my bad that I did not asked the teacher at once when I could not solve the problems. I checked the website that the teacher offer to us which would teach us how to build a perfect website. </h3>
			<h3>Today also is the due day of our first assignment. I hope that my first assignment can get a good score to make a perfect start of this class in the semester. Good luck for everybody. </h3></p>

Like the start of Mark Zuckerberg website creation, he collected the whole girls in Harvard University and posted on the website for all the students to compare without the permission of those girls which showed unrespect for the women. What’s more, he broke up with his girlfriend, then he posted some private information about his girlfriend on the website that was very shame behave.

While, in the second half, Los Angeles Clipper try to purse the score. The big leading of the Los Angeles turn to just 7. Fortunately, Henry who is the second year player in NBA step forward bravely, he shoot a three and get two free throw, successfully damped the fire on the Los Angeles Clipper. </h3>

			<h3>You can’t depend on someone else to make you happy. That is a lesson I learned early on in my marriage. I realized that I couldn’t rely on my husband as my source of happiness. I learned that my happiness depended on me and not my husband’s actions. I learned that you have to choose to be happy. You can choose your emotions. True happiness comes from within, it can’t be forced by outside forces. So how do you choose happiness? The same way you choose to smile or choose to wear a certain outfit. You choose it because that’s what you want to experience in your life.</h3>
			<h3>You want to buy a new pair of shoes so you choose a pair that you like and feels good. You wouldn’t buy a pair of shoes that you don’t like or that don’t fit well, right? So why do we keep choosing emotions and feelings that don’t make us feel good? Well most people don’t realize that you can choose feeling happy over feeling angry or upset about something. It’s not wrong to feel angry or upset but dwelling on it and letting the anger simmer for too long can have bad results.</h3></p>

			<h3>Nowadays, almost everybody has a blog, like my parents, even my grandparents all have their own blogs. Thanks to the Internet is much more easily to access, blogs are becoming more and more popular around us.</h3>
			<h3>Why do people like blogs so much? In my opinion, it is determined by people's potential desire to write something for others. Many people who think themselves have literal talents always want to find a platform to show their writing skills. Blogs are the very place for them to realize their dreams. Writing on blogs is quite simple. You don’t need to submit an article to newspapers or magazines, and to wait for the approval of editors (it would fail in many cases). If you want to write something on your blog, just turn on the computer and access to the Net, and then type anything conjured up. After pressing the OK button, your new article is online. Other people around the world, even he/she is in Africa, can immediately read your article, provided he/she has a computer and can get to the Net.</h3>
			<h3>The blog really provides an excellent platform for tradition people to display their recent activities, and it is also a good way or people to share views and get information. However, like many other new things, the blog is also a double-edged sword. It might be used by some people who have ulterior motives to spread rumors or to slander other people. So blogs need to be well monitored. As long as the correlated authorities properly manage the blog, it can play a brilliant role in our society.</h3></p>
