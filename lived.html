Lived Experiences Project
	Technology changed life. With the development of technology, our living environment becomes more and more comfortable and convenience. For instance, network was an awesome invention which deeply influenced our daily life. It helped people see what is happening all around the world at anytime and anywhere; It allowed us to acquire the status of our friends through Facebook, Twitter and any other social network; It colored our spare time that we can play games or chat with friends through the Internet. What’s more, there are a lot of business opportunities on the Internet. Since all those stuffs are worked through computer, I choose computer as my major in college. 
	Nowadays, people can’t live without their computer. Computers are widely used in the world, almost in every fields we can see computer. As for me, I regard computer to be a vital part in my life, we can’t be apart no matter at study, read newspaper, listen to music or some entertainment events. What’s more, computer enabled me to mange my files better. Hence, I used to taking note by computer since I don’t have to worry about losing it thus even in the end of the semester, I can review what I have learned easily thanks to computer. While, in my spare time, the computer helped me relax as well since there are various kinds of computer games. It not only saved our time, but also saved our money since it is easy for us to search for music through the Internet on the computer so that we can find whatever we want and enjoy it. Computer also makes the relationship between my friends, family members and I better. Through social networks, I can get the latest news from my friends online, in this way, we could have better communication with our friends which might enhance our relationship. Besides it, social networks are good platforms to make new friends. Meanwhile, there are still a little bit flaws in these websites, and I am yearning for fixing those problems. That is one of the reasons I choose computer as my major. 
Another reason that pushed me to select computer as my college major is the experience of the first time I played the computer games. In addition to the interest of the games, I wondered how it processed, not only the game itself, but also the computer system. I started to figure out the components of computer and tried to learn how each part of component related to each other. This was the first time that I get start interesting in computer. The second thing impressed me a lot about computer was my Windows system did not work, I hesitated about whether to fix the problem myself. Eventually I decided to do it! This is the first time I try to learn the system. I opened my laptop and search the solution online, I spent a lot of time on figuring it out and successfully grasped how to do it. However, life is tough and I failed to fix the problem at the first time, and I made it even worse. I did really do not know what was wrong during the process, as a result, I have to find a store to fix it. This experience taught me don not do it unless you are fully prepared. On the other hand, this experience also inspired me to explore the mystery world of computer.  
	As we are discussing computer, we have to mention a successful man who is also the person I admired named Bill Gates. There is no doubt that no one in the world does not know what is Microsoft and who is Bill Gates. Bill Gates was not only the founder of Microsoft but also an investor, programmer, inventor and philanthropist. Although Bill Gates didn’t finish his college, his abilities would never be buried. With the help of Steve Ballmer, they created the ‘Altair 8800’ and earned the partnership from IBM. In the 1985, Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows, and in the future years, Microsoft caught up IBM and finally became the biggest company in the world. However, the process of success is not as easy as it seem to be. This is a world which one is shaped by their decision. IBM did ever will to buy the Microsoft when they realized the potential of it. While, Bill Gates didn’t baffled by the current profit, he insisted creating his own product and eventually become the richest man in the world. It is Bill Gates’ superior skill of programming that make him insisted his dream. The story of Bill Gates enlightened me, it taught me the importance of persistence and work hard meanwhile the comprehensive skills of computer is a basic factor. What’s more, we should on ours own way, don’t consider too much about others view.
	In addition to the interests, economic factor is one of the reasons I chose to study on computer. The successful example of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg let me realized that it is a brilliant way to earn money through the Internet, compare to industries, we only need create one and sell to billion people while industries should product billion to sell to billion people. The innovation plays an important role in network industry, we should have something special then we can attract people to buy your inventions. I am a person who always seeks to unique. Besides made the program perfect, I always added my own ideas in my projects and tried to find whether there is a better way to work out the problem. Beside that, I used to challenge difficult objects. The harder the objects are, the more concentration I would be. All those qualities make me go on studying on computer.
	Fortunately, my father supported me studying in computer though he is a successful businessman. He gave me both financial support and spirit support. He told me a lot about how he created his own business, sharing the experiences to me so that I can start on a higher level. Beside that, he used asked some professional computer programmers to teach me some knowledge, skill and experiences to be a good programmer. It helped me a lot. While, my friends who also study in the computer field always share their resource to me so that I can broaden my eye. When we are free, we used to do our homework and review what we had learnt in the class together. Once we encountered problems, we tried to work together and work it out. Meanwhile, I found it is an awesome shortcut to make friend with girls. As most girls were not interesting in computer, it was a good timing for me to performance when they met problems. 
This is the second year that I study computer at Michigan State University. I tried the computer science course in last semester, it really made my classmates and I crazy. However, through the hardworking and countless practice, I overcame the problems and got an outstanding grade in the course. I hope I would have a good trip on the road of computer.
