			<h1>Social change by taking risks</h1>
			<p>Grand Theft Auto which officially abbreviated to GTA is a famous video game that used series of criminal theme. The game contains a large number of satire American cultures and the content of the social phenomenon, while, the game pornographic violence caused controversy. However, Grand Theft Auto series on business and public was a great success, the series of global accumulative total sales of more than 150 million that made them one of the most popular video game in history. However, some players let off their steams of the society by this game. They used to endure the injustice instead of encourage themselves to change the bad situation. 
‘Found only give opportunity to people who is persistence, it would be never encountered by coward.’ stated by famous explorer Christopher Columbus. While many people think of taking risks as trivial and unimportant, taking risks is regarded to be a precious archive of highly repetitive experience and events. It has a lot of benefits to society such as achieve equality, develop society and advance society. In numerous societies, the paths of human experience hold striking resemblances. 
	The process of addressing injustice is brutal. Therefore, no equality can be achieved without taking risks. One may encounter a great deal of challenge during his or her pursuit of justice. Throughout this process, a person has to face all challenge by taking risks or otherwise he will eventually fail. In the United States in the 1960s, Martin Luther King was a famous civil rights activist who devoted his entire life to the anti- exaggeration movements with the idea of nonviolent protest MLK changed the America society in peace. However, the process was not as easy as it seemed to be. Once in 1963, a group of white extremists burned his house in Atlanta, warning him to stay away from the civil rights movements. These extremists attempted to stop the movement by scaring the leader away. Meanwhile, MLK didn’t quit his career even though his life was under threat. He still traveled around the whole nation, making speeches and organizing all the protests. Not until the night of 1968 when the assassination took place did Dr.King stop working. Under his great influence, the U.S started an era, an era when the colored population was no longer inferior to the white people. He could not achieve so without taking risks. If MLK choose to stop back when his life is threatened, American people would still be divided by skin color nowadays.
	Furthermore, in the article, Merriman (2008) said that nonviolent action is a way that normal people fight for their rights, freedom, and justice. Nonviolent action is based on the insight that power in a society is ultimately derived from people’s consent and obedience’ Once the society is no longer equal, people have the obligation to address the justice. People fight together for their benefits, for instance, the War of Resistance against Japan, Chairman Mao lead the Chinese overcome a lot of trouble, went through varies of straitened circumstances, ultimately won over the peace to China. While, 'the Indian Independence Movement focused its efforts on gaining concessions from the British on the Salt Acts and other laws in 1930-1931’. These victories show that people have both the capacity and the obligation to strive for their rights if only we try to take risks.
	Taking risks develop the society, the inspiration from the risks made our daily life become more comfortable and convenience. After a lot of experiments, Thomas Alva Edison devised the light which bright the world in the night; After thousand times improved, the Wrightbrothers created the airplane which made human beings’ sky dream come true. A lot of scientists devote their entire life to take risks in dangerous devices, they tried again and again with a view to making innovation to develop the society. Thanks to their perseverance, our life becomes more and more perfect. Through the process of taking risks, people will realize what they should be done to make the society better. For instance, once people injured in accident when took risks, we would think about why it happened and how to solve it, in this way, we would avoid it next time. This is a king of progress. 
	One’s life is determined by himself rather than by god. If a person chooses to take a risk for him dream, he can earn a chance to succeed. This is a world where everyone is shaped by the decision they made. In the movie ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’ (Muccino, 2006) Chris Gardner demonstrated the American Dream. The movie, altogether with the original story, motivated millions of people to achieve their dreams through hard working and brave to take risks. As a lower class black man, Chris Gardner grew up in a poor family that failed to support him to finish the high school study. He started to work at the age of 18 and lived in a corrupted neighbor in San Francisco. In his thirties, his wife left the family because Chris could not make a living on selling medical equipment. In order to take care of his 7-year-old son, Chris decided to work for an stock bank. During the 6 months internship, Chris received no salary. Thus he tried hard to sell the medical equipment, or otherwise he could not continue the daily life. In the end, Chris got the job after the internship because he work hardest and he was persistence. By not giving up and working hard, Chris eventually become a millionaire in the stock market. This experience showed that we would have a chance to success if we are brave enough to take risks.
	No progress simply means regression, taking risks is vital to keep the society progressing. In the article, Smith (2006) stated that a kind of people whose are called Type T are risk-taker and adventures whose are keen on excitement and stimulation no matter where they can find or create it and Type T’s personality is born with some people. These people are always willing to take risks and devoting their energy to work it out. Their consciousness of challenge make the society keep developing. For example, Mark Zuckerberg who is the founder of Facebook. he got his first computer when he was ten years old, from now on, he spent a lot of time is spent on the computer. In high school, he designed a MP3 player for the school. After that many companies offered him a job, including Microsoft. But Zuckerberg refused the $950,000 job opportunities, and chose to go to Harvard University. In the second year at Harvard University, he broke into the school’s database, using photos of students on their own design website, for classmates evaluate each other's appeal which cause a great sensation on campus. Then Mark Zuckerberg realized that the social networking site is popular in the student community. He decided to go on with this field and later, he created Facebook which users must register before using the site, after they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile. Thanks to his persist to innovate which advance the social network even though he faced a lot of problems such as finical and one of his partners accused him. Finally, he became the most youth billionaire in the world. 
  	Meanwhile, another kind of people whose are defined as hero promoted society as well. Tollefson (1993) defined that hero is the person who respect for human, faith in one’s ability to make a difference, original perspective, physical and mental courage, and public or unpublic impact’ Everyone can be a hero if only he or she has the character above and because of the character above one has, he or she is absolutely devote his or her life to improve the society. Hero always is incentives to develop innovations that change our social in a better way. For instance, Steve Jobs is the hero who devoted his whole life in creating unique products. He is a famous inventors, and entrepreneurs, apple co-founder and former chief executive. On April 1, 1976 jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayn founded the company, he accompanied the decades of ups and downs with the Apple company, Apple has the leadership and launched the electronic products like Macintosh computer, iMac, iPod, iPhone that popular one hundred million people in the world's, profoundly changed the way of modern communication, entertainment and daily life. On October 5, 2011, he was prevented by illness, died at the age of 56. The genius of Steve Jobs was to change the world, with his keen sense of touch and great wisdom, courage to change, innovation, leading the trend of the global information technology and electronic products. However, the road of success is rough. Because of Jobs' business philosophy, unlike most managers, plus IBM also began to wake up and also introduced a personal computer that dominated large market, cause the new developed computer made by Jobs be unsuccessful, and the directors, general manager of blame for the failure of the chairman Steve Jobs, in the year of 1985, the board of directors withdrew his power on April. Steve Jobs tried several times to regain power while it had not been successful, then on September 17, 1985 angry resigned as chairman of apple. The experience of resign made himself aware of his mistakes, absorb lesson moral. It also prepare for him to return Apple and save it in the future. After resigned a few days later, Steve Jobs founded the "NeXT" computer company continued to start his business trip. In the end of the year 1996, Steve Jobs successfully made the first computer animated cartoon "Toy Story" that made his personal wealth had jumped more than $1 billion; In contrast, apple was on the verge of despair. Steve Jobs decided to back to the place he dreamed for, His said to followers of Apple company that he was proud of designing the blueprint for the future of apple again and he felt great pleasure for that. Once the hero finally return under the highly desirable! He broke the monopoly of Microsoft and changed our mind about computers, music players, and mobile phones, leading our to a new technology era. It is impossible for Jobs to achieve that without original perspective and mental courage.  
	Taking risks have a paramount effect on the society since it not only achieved the equality but also develop the society, meanwhile, keep the society progress and inspire human beings to innovate. Both the experience of Chris Gardner and Martin Luther King demonstrated we are able to change our life to a better situation. If only we try to take risks the world will be much more fantastic.
